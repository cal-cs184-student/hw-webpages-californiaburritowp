		-->

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>This write-up details my implementation of 
			
			several algorithms and techniques in order to better render and work with triangle mesh objects,
			as well as the challenges I encountered while coding and their solutions. Some focuses were using Bezier curves to represent curved shapes, 
			Phong shading to improve quality, and mesh processing functions like flipping, splitting, and upsampling for various other purposes.
		</p>
		<p>For the Bezier curve and surface tasks, I implemented de Casteljau’s algorithm to recursively evaluate control points and generate 
			smooth curves and surfaces. In the mesh processing tasks, I implemented area-weighted vertex normals to achieve smoother (Phong) shading, 
			along with mesh modification functions such as edge flips and edge splits. The loop subdivision task required splitting edges, flipping necessary edges, 
			and updating vertex positions to refine the mesh. 
		</p>
		<p> The major challenges I encountered were in debugging and sometimes in fully understanding the intended function of the algorithms I was implementing. 
			Carefully structuring the recursive steps and my variable names, as well as splitting up pieces of algorithms and checking pointers while running the 
			program helped me to overcome these issues.
        </p> 
        <p>Through this homework, I deepened my understanding of recursive interpolation, half-edge data structures, mesh processing, and subdivision techniques 
			used commonly in computer graphics. The hands-on experience with these algorithms also reinforced my importance of precision and careful debugging, 
			improving my coding process.

		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
		In the rendering pipeline, the role of ray generation is to set up the rays for use. The primitive intersection phase tests each ray for collision with scene primitives using efficient algorithms - for example, in my implementation I used Moller-Trumbore for triangles. These intersections are used to determine color contributions to the pixels we eventually render.
		<p>The triangle intersection algorithm I implemented, Moller-Trumbore, takes a scene triangle's edge vectors and a ray. First, it checks for a determinant of 0, 
		meaning a ray parallel to the triangle; in this case there is no intersection. Then it calculates the barycentric coordinates as well as intersection time t,
		using them to determine if the ray enters the triangle's plane inside/outside the triangle and if the intersection happens between the ray's start and end points.</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h3>
		<p> My BVH construction algorithm recursively subdivides the set of primitives; each call, it finds 
			the Bounding Box of the current set of primitives and selects the longest axis for division. 
			Then, it calculates the heuristic: it averages the centroids of the primitives along
			that axis, setting the split point to that average to partition the set into even groups.
		</p>
		
		<p>To compare runtimes, I have detailed the rendering runtimes of a few medium sized scenes.
		My implementation rendered Maxplanck.dae in 626.3842s seconds without BVH acceleration, 0.1632 seconds with it.
		It rendered Peter.dae in 452.2540 seconds without BVH acceleration, 0.1111 sec seconds with it.
		It rendered Beast.dae in 642.2554 seconds without BVH acceleration, 0.1393 seconds with it. As you can see from the numbers, 
		the BVH acceleration speeds up the rendering process by around 4000 times, bringing an otherwise impractically long
		rendering process significantly closer to one we might be able to use in something like video games.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		To implement the area-weighted vertex normal, I edited the Vertex::normal() function to take the area-weighted average of neighboring triangle normals, then normalizing that average. 
		<p>In order to do this, I initialized a norma sumNormal to (0,0,0), then looped through the halfedges rooted at the current vertex. For each halfedge, I iterated through its face’s vertices in counter clockwise order using calls to ->next() and ->vertex(), taking their positions to calculate the face’s normal, which equals the cross product of the first two edge vectors. This normal was added to sumNormal. After the loop, I normalized the sumNormal to give the result: an area-weighted vertex normal.</p>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		<p>To implement edge flipping, I first asserted that the input was not a boundary edge. 
			Then, I changed values for all the Iters and their pointers that should be affected by the flipping of an edge 
			– that is, half-edges, vertices, and faces. By naming the vertices “a” through “d” (i.e. vA), and half-edges by vertex direction
			 (i.e. heCA), I kept it easy enough to keep track at a glance of where pointers that needed to change would go. 
			 Switching edge (b,c) to (a,d) gave a clear direction of how half edges would need their pointers ( ‘next’ and ‘face’ to be precise) changed, 
			 and from there it was a matter of reassigning vertices and faces to the same names, but new values of halfEdges they were previously assigned to. 
			</p>
		<p>My debugging journey was, thankfully, mostly uneventful – aside from the time I fell asleep while coding. That left me with a couple stray characters typed around my function that I had to root out. Luckily, it was a fairly quick process.
		</p>
		<p>See screenshots below of a basic teapot, one with a few flipped edges, and one with many adjacent consecutively flipped edges.

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		<p>To implement the edge split operation, I looked at the graphic in the instructions and listed down every halfedge, vertex, edge, and face I would need to edit. By putting in use a good naming convention that referred to halfedges by the vertices they connected, and the rest of the structures by their corresponding halfedge (except vertices, they were named vA-vD, vM), I avoided getting confused while moving pointers around. 
			Then, I created variables for each of the structures that was involved in the split, calling empty constructors for newly created ones. I (re)assigned all halfedges using setNeighbors(), then (re)assigned the edges, faces, and vertices to their respective halfedges as well. Finally, I returned the newly created vertex, vM.
		</p>
		<p>A combination of process I used to name each structure, meticulously combing through the logic of how new/old structures should look like, and lots of luck helped my implementation to work without any major debugging mishaps.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		<p>I implemented the Mesh Upsampling by closely following the steps laid out in the implementation notes. 
			First, I calculated all the newPosition values of the original vertices, and marked their isNew = false. 
			Then I set all old edges’ newPosition values and isNew values, splitting all the original edges and marking 
			the new edges during the split, filling new vertices' values with the edge->newPosition. I followed that by 
			flipping any new edges that connected new and old vertices together. Lastly, I updated all vertex’s positions to their newPosition value. 
			</p><p>While debugging, I was very stuck on figuring out why few vertices wouldn’t have the correct position on every 
			‘L’ key press. To figure out my issue, I went through the vertices, edges, and halfedges involved by selecting 
			their data via the interface and checked that their pointer values were as intended. Using that process, I was 
			able to find a small error in my edge flip function where one of the vertices had its halfedge pointer going to 
			the twin of the correct halfedge.
		</p>
		<p>Loop subdivision smooths a mesh out, so the sharp corners and edges become increasingly rounded as loops of the 
			algorithm are carried out. You can reduce this effect through extra splits to change how much the subdivision 
			process can actually round a shape since a larger amount of the original face will remain in place. Compare the 
			screenshots directly below – the face with several extra splits done on it keeps its shape much better than the 
			untouched faces through the subdivision process.
		</p>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				  <img src="28.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Upsampled cube - you can see the split face is much flatter.</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>You can pre-process the cube to make it subdivide symmetrically. In this cube’s case, the way to do it is by splitting each face’s 
		singular edge across into 4 symmetric edges so that the mesh’s edges have the same symmetry a cube does. This edge symmetry gives 
		our loop subdivision a uniform, symmetric base to subdivide upon, which results in symmetric shapes even when subdivided. Compare 
		the sequential sets of screenshots below with each other to see the difference.
